## Hey there- I'm Krishna!

I am a high schooler getting into the world of programming. I love building solutions and tools that serve people. Currently into spatial computing, C#, TypeScript, and rapid prototyping.

I'm currently working on a portfolio of ventures where I spend most of my time designing immersive workflows. Some projects I've worked on include:
- A VR-to-BIM edit pipeline for Revit and Quest VR --> Soon to be a full VR-based AEC tool for 3D roomscale design
- A CDaR Quant Finance modeling algorithm for portfolio risk management and mitigation that analyzes past trends and generates 3D reactive models (Kerr and SCHW)
- Enrollment forecasting algorithms for early learning centers and preschools
- A comprehensive Monte Carlo Simulation designed for projecting and simulating startup successes and runway
- A study OS tool for nodal mapping of topics on standardized tests
